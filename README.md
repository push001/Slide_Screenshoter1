# Slide_Screenshoter1
As a student while learning some topic often I have to refer to slides(Google slides). 
In case of important slides, I want to same them locally but since the download option is not provided so one of the workaround is to take the ScreenShot of all those slides and then save them.

When the number of slides is huge then definitely this task is time-consuming and mundane.
This program takes the screenshot of all the slides and save them.
