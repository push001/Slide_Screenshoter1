# Slide_Screenshoter
As a student while learning some new topic on the net, I often encountered some non - downloadable slides.
In case of important slides, I wanted to same them locally but since the download option was not provided so one of the workaround was to take the ScreenShot of all those slides and then save them.

When the number of slides is huge then definitely this task is time-consuming and mundane.
This program takes the screenshots of all the slides and save them.
